# product-list
This Product List web app is a fully responsive, client-side catalog built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically displays a collection of products and allows users to filter and sort items by category, price range, or alphabetical order. Each product is shown with its image, price, category, and description, along with an "Add to Cart" button for future e-commerce integration.

The app uses JavaScript to manage the filtering and sorting in real time without the need for page reloads or server-side code. It's ideal as a front-end demo for showcasing product listings, catalog navigation, or as a foundation for an online store interface.
